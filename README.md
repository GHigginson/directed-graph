# directed-graph

Sample code for working with directed graphs. Includes:

* a parser for validating the schema of a graph represented in xml
* a utility for querying routes between arbitrary nodes from a backing database
* an sql script for detecting cycles in a graph

Implemented as an excercise, the code in this repo is not intended for any practical purpose. Use at your own risk.
